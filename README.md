These HTML pages contain Javascript that uses CryptoJS to securely encrypt a message with a password.The index page has a message box to type the original message and then a password is submitted after clicking the "Lock Down" button. The message in the box is replaced by a URL where the message can be decoded, only if the same password is used in the decryption process.
